# Contact Author (Sourcegraph extension)

## ⚠️ Deprecation notice

**Sourcegraph extensions have been deprecated with the September 2022 Sourcegraph
release. [Learn more](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/extensions/deprecation).**

The repo and the docs below are kept to support older Sourcegraph versions.

## Description

Sourcegraph extension that lets you contact the author of a particular line of code (the last author who modified of that line) by email.

## How it works:

When you select a line while browsing a source file, the extension appends a "Contact author" link next to the line.

The link is a `mailto:` link which will automatically open your default email client, and will pre-fill the recipient, subject and body of the email with the file name and the quoted line of code.
